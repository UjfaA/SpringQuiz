# Quiz App


Quiz App is a web platform for quizzes. It is in an early alpha.  
You can check it out at: [https://quizapp.fun](https://quizapp.fun)
 
Quiz App is made with the help of awesome Java technology stack:

Vaadin: For building a dynamic and responsive web UI.  
Spring Boot: To streamline the development and deployment process.  
Spring Security: Ensuring secure access and authentication.  
Spring AI: Leveraging AI capabilities to enhance the user experience.  
EclipseStore: For efficient and scalable data storage.  
Project Lombok: To minimize boilerplate code and enhance productivity.  
 

The project is an evolution of SpringQuiz. You can explore the previous iteration in the `basic` branch of this repository.
