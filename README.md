After registering, the user is able to answer questions. At the end user is presented with a score.
A user with appropriate account is able to add and delete questions and see user info and stats about the quiz.

The intent of this project is to practice using Spring and other technologies.

The project is made with the help of Spring Boot, Spring Web MVC, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, MySQL and Project Lombok,
and on the front-end side with Thymeleaf and W3.CSS.

When running locally you will need to edit application.properties or configure environmental variables. You will need to change DDL setings.
