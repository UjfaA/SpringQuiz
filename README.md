# SpringQuiz

SpringQuiz is Demo Quiz web app. It is running on Heroku platform.  
You can check it out at: [https://spring-quiz.herokuapp.com](https://spring-quiz.herokuapp.com)

After registering, the user is able to answer questions. At the end of the quiz, the user is presented with a score.  
A user with appropriate account is able to add and delete questions and see user info and stats about the quiz.

The intent of this project is to explore using Spring with focus on Spring Data and other technologies.

The project is made with the help of Spring Boot, Spring Web MVC, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, MySQL and Project Lombok  
and on the front-end side with Thymeleaf and W3.CSS.

The project is now updated to Spring Boot 3.

When running locally you will need to edit application.properties or configure environmental variables. You will need to change DDL settings.

Feel free to contact me about any question, suggestion etc.
